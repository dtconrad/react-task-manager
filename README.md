## Overview/Description
The **Task Manager App** is a simple React-based application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It includes features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, filtering tasks based on their status (all, completed, or incomplete), and deleting tasks. Additionally, the app includes a contact page where users can submit their contact information and comments.

The app is designed with a clean, user-friendly interface and responsive layout.

## How to Use
1. **Home Page**:
   - Add a new task using the input field and "Add Task" button.
   - View tasks in a side-by-side layout with the "Add Task" form on the left and the task list on the right.
   - Filter tasks by clicking the "All", "Completed", or "Incomplete" buttons.
   - Mark tasks as completed by clicking on the task text (applies a strikethrough effect).
   - Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.

2. **About Page**:
   - Provides a brief description of the app.

3. **Contact Page**:
   - Submit your first name, last name, email, and comments through a contact form.
   - The form is a controlled component, meaning all input fields update the app's state in real-time.

## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. **Task Editing**:
   - Add functionality to edit an existing task.

2. **Local Storage Integration**:
   - Save tasks to local storage so that they persist even after the app is closed or refreshed.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.

4. **Dark Mode**:
   - Provide a toggle for light/dark mode to improve accessibility and user experience.

5. **Backend Integration**:
   - Implement a backend server (e.g., Node.js with a database like MongoDB) to store tasks and contact form submissions.

6. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Further optimize the app for mobile devices with better touch-friendly controls and layouts.
